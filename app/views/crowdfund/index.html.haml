              %strong What are we doing?
              We are fitting out the worlds first bitcoin based floating hackspace and setting sail continously around the world on 100% clean, sustainable energy. All with the aims of inspiring people to see what's possible and to learn more about making, decentralisation and Bitcoin.
            %p
              Many recent projects are largely intangalbe, so one of our aims is to bring a dramatic physical project into the spotlight, capturing peoples imaginations and showing what a few enthusiastic people can do.
            %p
              Everything about the project is open source and bitcoin based, encouraging fresh new real world uses. When not possible to use bitcoin directly, we will fall back on bitcoin-backed services.

            %p
              %strong Why are we doing it?
              We've always had a passion for sailing, technology, environmentalism, open source software and decentralisation. So a hackspace aboard a catamaran seems like the ideal experiment

            %p
              %strong How will funds be used?
              Firstly all donations are safely kept across multiple mutisig cold storage wallets distributed across multiple sites.

              The majority of funds will go towards the purchase and outfitting of a suitable sailing catamaran. It feels right to seek out a used boat for sale in an ecconomy recently let down by the financial sector then offer to buy it at a premium with Bitcoin.

              The remaining funds will be used to see us over for two years, giving everyone the chance to come aboard.

              Year 3 we aim to grow the fleet, to allow more people to stay board, opening up the space to more people long term.
