        %p.lead
          We currently work on getting our community forum up and running on a
          decentralized platform. For that we’re using the amazing
          = link_to "Secure Scuttlebutt", "https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebot/"
          , which is great new tool, in part designed
          for offshore and patchy internet use.

        %p.lead
          As we believe that decentralized, unstoppable and incorruptible
          information exchange is important for an equal and fair future, we want
          to provide the same for everyone at Entropy.

        %p.lead
          Secure Scuttlebutt is a p2p crypto-chain designed for social apps.
          You only receive messages from people you follow, and people who are
          one step away from those you follow. Secure messages are broadcast to
          everyone, so not only are they secure, but their recipients are known
          to no one except those involved.

        %p.lead
          This system is especially interesting as it allows for updating
          messages outside of internet access as users can synchronise messages
          on the same wifi network, ideal for a boat!

        %p.lead
          Until then we’ll have to deal with the centralised behemoth of

        %h2 DAO Testing Rollout Plan
        %span.text-muted 21st June 2016

        %h4.lead Waved Beta Rollouts & Upper Funding Limit

        %p.lead
          It's fundamentally important that we manage the creation, trust and
          safety of Entropy as it comes to life.

        %p.lead
          Our proposed staged rollout plan involves building and testing the
          bare minimum necessary to evolve the project in slow, explicityly
          controlled waves with set funding limits, community review of all
          changes and citizen control over when we progres to the next wave.

        %h3 Wave 1: New Horizon
        %p.text-muted
          %i Minimal Viable Entropy
        %p.lead
          This wave sees us bootstrap the community, start testing ideas and
          confirm the projects foundations are good. Limits are in place to
          keep the number of Citizens, invested Ether and risk to safer levels.

          Once the community consensus that we are ready is reached, this wave adds additional
          power to Actions, including sending ether; changes to the Steering
          Committee and revoking existing desciscions.
