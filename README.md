Project Entropy
================

What are we doing? Our dream is to fit out the worlds first Bitcoin based floating hackspace and set sail continuously around the world on 100% clean, sustainable energy.

Bitcoin projects are largely intangible, so one of our aims is to bring blockchain based technology into the spotlight, capturing peoples imaginations and showing what a few enthusiastic people can do.

Everything about the project is bitcoin based, encouraging fresh new real world uses. When not possible to use bitcoin directly, we will fall back on bitcoin-backed services.
